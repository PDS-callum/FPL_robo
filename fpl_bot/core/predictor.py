Advanced Points Predictor - Rewritten

Based on approaches from successful FPL bots:
- Uses xG/xA (expected goals/assists) when available
- Better fixture difficulty using actual team performance
- Realistic clean sheet probabilities
- Improved minutes prediction
- Double gameweek support
- Evidence-based scoring models
